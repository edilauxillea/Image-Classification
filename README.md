# Introduction
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves assigning labels to images based on their content. This project focuses on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to train a model capable of classifying images into predefined categories. The repository provides code and instructions to preprocess the data, train a CNN model, and evaluate its performance.

# Installation
To use the code in this repository, perform the following steps:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/edilauxillea/Image-Classification.git
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Follow these steps to perform image classification using CNN:
1. Prepare your dataset by following the instructions in the Dataset section.
2. Preprocess the data as described in the Preprocessing section.
3. Train the CNN model using the steps provided in the Model Training section.
4. Evaluate the performance of the model using the instructions in the Evaluation section.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle. It consists of a collection of images of cats and dogs. Each image is labeled as either a cat or a dog.

# Preprocessing
Before training the CNN model, the dataset needs to be preprocessed. Follow these steps for preprocessing:
1. Load the images and labels from the dataset.
2. Resize the images to a consistent size suitable for the CNN model.
3. Normalize the pixel values of the images.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

# Model Training
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification. The steps for training a CNN model are as follows:
1. Design the architecture of the CNN model, including the number and configuration of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
2. Initialize the CNN model with suitable hyperparameters.
3. Train the model using the preprocessed training data.
4. Optimize the model by adjusting hyperparameters and using techniques like regularization or dropout.
5. Save the trained model for future use.

# Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the trained CNN model, follow these steps:
1. Load the saved model.
2. Preprocess the testing data using the same steps as mentioned in the Preprocessing section.
3. Use the model to predict labels for the testing images.
4. Calculate relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. Analyze the results and interpret the model's performance.
